ABSTRACT

The median income of a county is the best indicator of the overall health of the economy at the micro level since it reflects the 
livelihood, education and state of governance in a county. Hence, predicting median income and understanding the causal factors 
that affect it can prove to be extremely useful for planning and evaluating the impact of public policy. Linear regression proves 
to be an effective technique to model linear relationships between dependent and independent variables. In this report, we use linear 
regression to understand the relationships between the factors that affect the median income at the county level in US. The dataset was 
generated using publicly available US demographic data for 2016. After removing outliers and feature engineering, the linear regression
model found key factors that predict income at a county level to a high degree of accuracy.
